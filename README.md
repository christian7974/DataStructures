# Data Structures Portfolio

## Inspiration
I wanted to teach myself Java as I did not have too many projects with Object-Oriented Programming. I chose Java over
other object-oriented languages since it lends itself to web application development better than other languages
such as C++ and C. 

I thought the best way of practicing Java while keeping my programming skills sharp was to implement data structures
and algorithms, since those are very important pillars in computer science and software engineering. I also wanted
to work on JavaDoc comments so that people understand what a given method does and some of the intermediate steps
of those methods. 

## Technologies Used
- Java

## Current DS/Algorithms Implemented
While this is not an exhaustive list of every data structure and algorithm, these are the ones that I have seen the most
in my classes and have gotten fairly comfortable with. 

### Currently Implemented Data Structures
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Hash Tables
- Binary Trees

### Currently Implemented Algorithms
- Breadth First Search
- Depth First Search (In-, Pre-, Post-Order)

## How to Contribute
Since this is my first time using Java, it may be evident that I could have implemented a method a different way or
could have used a different method/syntax. If that is the case, I am all ears as to how I can strengthen my skills in
Java (or OOP in general). Feel free to create an issue and to include:
- Which package the code is in
- What I have done wrong/inefficient
- Some helpful tips to mitigate that problem
- If you have a Java/OOP resource (i.e. a YouTube Channel or website) then I would appreciate if you could include that, 
as it would help me learn Java by exploring other sources of documentation.

## Planned Data Structures/Algorithms
Some planned data structures and algorithms include but are not limited to:
- Trees
  - Binary Heaps/Priority Queues
- Graphs
- Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Quick and Merge Sort
- Dynamic Programming
